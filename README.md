# SmartEdu: Revolutionizing Education Through Technology

Welcome to SmartEdu, the winning project of the 24-hour hackathon hosted by Malla Reddy University, under the theme of Smart Education. Our project aims to leverage cutting-edge technology to enhance the educational experience, making learning more interactive, engaging, and accessible to students everywhere.

## Team: Tech Wizards

# Project Overview
SmartEdu is a platform that redefines the way educational content is delivered and consumed. By integrating 3D visualizations and interactive learning modules, we aim to provide a more immersive learning experience that caters to the diverse needs of students. Our solution focuses on making complex concepts easier to understand and retain, leveraging the power of visualization and interaction.

*Tech Stack*
Our project utilizes a robust technology stack to deliver a seamless and powerful user experience:

*Front-End:*
_React.js:_ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
_Redux:_ A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, ensuring consistent behavior across our application.
_Three.js and drei:_ JavaScript libraries and abstractions that enable immersive 3D graphics within web browsers without the use of plugins.
*Back-End:*
_Mongoose:_ An elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js, enabling rapid development of database schemas.
_React-Auth-Toolkit:_ A toolkit for handling authentication workflows in React applications.
_MongoDB:_ A NoSQL database designed for scalability and performance.

# *Team*
Our project was brought to life by a dedicated team of developers and leaders:

**Sindhu Ravuri: Core Developer**

**Sarthak Aitha: Backend Developer**

**Varun Harinath: Front-End Developer**

**Reshmi Kumari: Project Lead**

Together, we combined our expertise in various domains to develop a solution that stands out in its approach to enhancing the educational landscape.

# *Features*
SmartEdu introduces several key features designed to make learning more effective and enjoyable:

**_Interactive 3D Models:_ Complex concepts are explained through interactive 3D models, allowing students to explore and manipulate objects for a better understanding.**

**_Customizable Learning Paths:_ Students can customize their learning paths based on their strengths and weaknesses, enabling personalized education.**

**_Real-Time Collaboration:_ Enables students and teachers to collaborate in real-time, enhancing the learning experience through interactive sessions.**


*Getting Started*
To get started with SmartEdu, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
       `git clone https://github.com/VarunHarinath/SmartEdu`
   
3. Install NPM packages for both frontend and backend
          `cd SmartEdu`
            `cd frontend && npm install`
            `cd ../backend && npm install`
  
5. Set up your environment variables in .env files within both the frontend and backend directories according to the provided .env.example files.
   
6. Start the backend server
    ` cd backend`
     `nodemon index.js`
   
7. Start the frontend application
     `cd frontend`
    ` npm run dev`

      Since this project is set up using Vite, use npm run dev to start the development server.
               Your application should now be running on `localhost:3000`
